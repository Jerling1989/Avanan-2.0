            <p>Due to ongoing issues regarding transatlantic data transfers to the United States of America, Avanan has established dedicated processing facilities within the European Union to ensure adequate data protections are in place. This eliminates the need for any further permission or agreement such as the Privacy Shield.</p>
            <p>To support the provision of the services and intended purposes listed above, Avanan uses a number of service providers that are commissioned by Avanan within the framework of the strict conditions of data processing in accordance with data protection legislation.</p>

            <p><strong>Right to deletion:</strong>&nbsp;<br>You can request that we delete your data provided the legal requirements have been met. In accordance with Article 17 of EU data protection regulations, this can be the case if:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>the data are no longer required for the purposes for which they were acquired or otherwise processed</li>
            <li>you revoke your consent, which is the basis of the data processing, and there is no other legal basis for the processing</li>

            <li>the data have been processed illegally</li>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Right to data transferability:&nbsp;</strong><br>At your request, we will transfer your data – where technically possible – to another responsible entity (GDPR, Article 20). However, this right only applies if the data processing is based on your consent or is required to fulfill a contract. Instead of receiving a copy of your data, you can ask us to send the data directly to another responsible entity that you specify.</p>
            <p><strong>Right to objection:&nbsp;</strong><br>You can object to the processing of your data at any time for reasons that arise from your special situation provided the data processing is based on your consent or our legitimate interest or that of a third party (GDPR, Article 21).

The latter does not apply if we are able to prove there are compelling, defensible reasons for the processing that outweigh your interests or we require your data to assert, exercise or defend against legal claims.</p>
            <p><strong>Time limits for compliance with the rights the persons affected</strong><br>As a general principle, we make every effort to comply with all requests within 30 days. This time limit, however, can be extended for reasons related to the specific rights of persons affected or the complexity of your request.</p>
            <p><strong>&gt;Restriction in the provision of information regarding the rights of persons affected</strong><br>In certain situations, legal specifications might require us not to provide information regarding all of your data. If we have to refuse your request for information in such a case, we will inform you of the reasons for refusal at the same time.</p>
